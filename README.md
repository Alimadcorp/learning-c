Programming with Sir Ijaz the Great

# Structure
## /build
Final outputs of all programs

## /programs
Contains all the .c programs

May get further divided into categories as we progress
### /programs/dev
Temporary build folder

## Build Tools
Use GCC or any C compiler really. Dont be using C++ please :skull:

It is preferred to add gcc.exe to path

To compile and run do:
```
    gcc <name>.c -o dev/out.exe; ./dev/out.exe
In /programs

All programs are also pre-built into the /build directory, double click any program to run.

To recompile all files, run compile.bat
